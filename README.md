For analyzing partial correlations (fig.7)
1. download data file: "Fig7_PartialCorrelation_example.mat"
2. download code: "MR_Heading.m" and make sure it is included in the Matlab path
3. download code: "PartialCorrelation_example.m"
4. run the code

For analyzing neurometric function
1. download data file: "Data_session.rar" and unzip to the created file path
2. download data file: "Neuron_list.rar" and unzip to the same directory
3. download and install the psignifit4 toolbox (from: https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit) and or download code: "psignifit.rar" and unzip to the same directory, and make sure it is included in the Matlab path 
4. download code: "Neuron_Analysis.m" 
5. run the code

For analyzing psychometric curves and perceptual decision models results:

download and install the psignifit4 toolbox (from: https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit) and make sure it is included in the Matlab path
download code: "analyze_loc_task_updated"
download data file: "loc_data.m"
make sure all files are in the same directory
run the code
optional - if you do not wish to run the code, you can skip steps 1-5 and simply download the results file: "loc_res.m" (for information regarding the results file, please see 'additional information for analyzing the data' section below).


download and install the psignifit4 toolbox (from: https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit) and make sure it is included in the Matlab path
download code: "plot_psych_curves_loc_task.m"
download data: "loc_summ_data4PSE.m"
make sure both files are in the same directory
run the code
