For analyzing neurometric function
1. download data file: "Data_session.rar" and unzip to the created file path
2. download data file: "Neuron_list.rar" and unzip to the same directory
3. download and install the psignifit4 toolbox (from: https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit) and or optional - you can download code: "psignifit.rar" and unzip to the same directory, and make sure it is included in the Matlab path 
4. download code: "Neuron_Analysis.m" 
5. run the code
6. optional - if you do not wish to run the code, you can skip steps 1-5 and simply download the results file: "Figure_Souce_Data.mat" and find the "SourceData.Fig3, 4, 5" for different areas
